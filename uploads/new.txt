Hi,

I am Md Asraful Alom from Evanston, IL. I have recently graduated from Loyola University Chicago with a Masters degree in Computer Science and am actively looking for Software Engineering position like this one. 

I have few years of Software Development experiences. Last Summer, I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at Trustwave Inc, a Chicago based Information Security company.  I have also other Software Development experiences working in varieties of companies, ranging from Telecommunications to Data mining research lab. 

I am most proficient in Java, Python. But also good at working with Scala, C#, C, C++ and other technologies like RESTful Web Services, .Net framework etc. I love to work with Data Structures, Algorithms, OOP, Design Patterns and TDD, have experiences on them too.

I found this job posting in Glassdoor. After going through the job description and required skills, I feel like I would be a best fit for it. Please have a look into my resume and LinkedIn profile for more detail experiences and skill sets.

Thanks.
